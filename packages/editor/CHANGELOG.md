## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6fda044: Adopt compact analytics styling: 32px default controls, outlined text entry,
  6px control corners, border-led cards and role typography. Style NumberCard,
  clarify dark chart palettes, and align block controls with the shared defaults.
  See spec/migrations.md for explicit props that retain previous defaults.
  
  Chart engines are registered by their wrapper. Raw ChartBase/useChart consumers
  register their own mark and coordinate-system modules through ECharts core.
  
  Typography utilities retain their names and use rem sizes so user text scaling
  is respected. Controls, badges and metrics reflow instead of clipping enlarged
  labels. All input families share Field help/error wiring without remounting
  uncontrolled state when validation appears. Settings tabs support vertical
  arrow, Home and End navigation.
- 6fda044: Default control sizing is now sm (28px), including buttons, text entry, selectors,
  date/time triggers, tabs, toggle groups and pagination. Explicit md remains 32px;
  checkboxes, radios and avatars retain their geometry. Consumers that require the
  previous default should pass size="md". Cards default to 12px padding; pass
  padding="md" for the previous 16px. Chart cards, editor toolbar commands and blocks use compact spacing.
  Page, section, metric and hero typography now follow 24/30, 18/24, 28/32 and
  36/40px respectively. Existing semantic colors and dialog padding are retained.
- 6fda044: Support BottomSheet drag dismissal with scroll handling, cancellation,
  non-dismissible sheets and reduced motion. Load CodeEditor grammars on demand
  while preserving edits and ignoring stale language requests after changes or
  unmounting.
  
  Expose paragraph, link editing and undo/redo in EditorToolbar. Disable formatting
  for readonly editors and history actions when their operation is unavailable.

### Patch Changes

- 6fda044: Refresh workspace dependencies to current stable releases. The Vite integration
  now requires Vite ^8.3.4. Consumer runtime dependencies, Solid development
  versions and Tailwind tooling are updated together; application examples migrate
  to TanStack Table 9. Type checking uses TypeScript 7, with Microsoft's TypeScript 6
  compatibility API retained for ESLint. Tests use Vitest 5 and Playwright 1.64.1.
  
  Keep visible labels in accessible names for calendar view controls and example
  actions; treat custom navigation avatars as decorative beside their labels.
  The updated axe checks stay enabled.
